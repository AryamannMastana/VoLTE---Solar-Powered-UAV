# Forest Surveillance UAV Structural Design
Working with a team of 5 members to design and construct a fixed wing, electric VTOL UAV that can be utilized to monitor changes and threats in a forest ecosystem.  
Analyzed and examined many materials and selected aluminum for the structural frame. Performed stress calculations for structural members to design against failure and determine appropriate dimensions for them.  
Currently fabricating wing as well as fuselage component and assembling avionics systems.
