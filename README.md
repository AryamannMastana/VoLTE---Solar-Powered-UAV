# VoLTE-Solar-Powered-UAV
Solar Powered Pseudo-Satellite VoLTE UAV Design
Worked with a team of 5 members to create a conceptual design of a fixed wing, electric solar UAV that provides local internet access and boosts internet connectivity in rural, hilly areas. 
Established mission specifications and surveyed existing UAV historical data. Calculated aircraft parameters and created a 3D model of the UAV.
Produced an 8 kg, 3.8 m wingspan UAV design with a payload capacity of 1 kg, cruise speed of 12 m/s and endurance of 3.5 hours.
